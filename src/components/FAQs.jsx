    question: 'How much does a used car engine cost?',
    answer:
      "Replacing your old or broken engine with a used car engine is usually the best and least expensive option. It will save your thousands of dollars & will provide the same efficiency as the used engine. The exact cost of a used engine will depend on many factors like the vehicle's model, year of manufacturing, type of engine needed, etc.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is it worth buying a used car engine?",

  },
  {
    question: "What happens when you put a used engine in your car?",
